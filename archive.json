As a soft requirement it is only aspirational so it doesn't fully matter if it isn't achieved, but it can also be explicitly addressed in any protocol design with a simple call out to DNS Notify and keeping the issue on the radar seems worthwhile to me.\r\n\r\nI'm mostly in favor of keeping it in, but won't fight for it if the wind blows against it.",

That makes the whole clause rather strange.\r\n\r\n         DELEG should enable a DNS operator to manage DNS service more\r\n         completely on behalf of domain administrators. For example, DELEG\r\n         could address long-standing issues of DNSSEC record maintenance\r\n         that now often depend on registrant / registrar interaction.\r\n\r\nShould this not be a \"hard requirement\"?\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "For the first one, the issue is that right now the records in a delegation are not signed.  Most of the discussion around a new method has included the notion that they would be signed, which is stronger.  I don't know that it needs more words in the document to clarify since it hasn't been brought up by others as confusing, but maybe just adding \"where delegations are unsigned\" after \"currently exists\" would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nFor \"This seems to talk about DNS outside of the EPP/registration world\" I'm not quite sure what the issue is here.   The requirement is simply that updating DELEG shouldn't be intrinsically harder than updating NS would be, via whatever mechanism is being used to do it.\r\n\r\nI disagree that \"to be effective\" makes that sentence all that strange, but also don't think it's adding much and don't really care whether it stays or goes.\r\n\r\nFor the last thing, no I don't think it should be a hard requirement.  The doc is fairly clearly that the hard requirements are mostly about what we're avoiding breaking, and the soft requirements are about the problem space that is trying to be solved.",
